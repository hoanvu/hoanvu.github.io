I've always been fascinated about doing something for the environment. Recently I had an idea about using blockchain to implement a system that can potentially reduce air pollution and increase people's health.

Have you ever imagined that you can earn money even by doing exercise, like simply walking, running or cycling? Imagine a system that encourage people to perform physical activities, and not just to make their health better, the system will give rewards in some form of token/cryptocurrency. That person who owns this token can then use it to exchange for discount when they use public transports like bus, train, ...

Each step you take will be measured and recorded on the blockchain, we can call this "Proof of Steps". This means nobody can hack the system and claim the steps he didn't take like we might have in a centralized system.

The end goal is to reduce personal vehicles on the road and increase public transport usage as well as on-foot travel. The system can even bonus participants if they walk or use public transports more often, or share together a taxi.
