I'm starting to review my C++ programming knowledge. It's more precise to say that I'm learning C++ again. Honestly this is first for better serving the job at the company I'm going to start next month, but more importantly, it's a skill that I need to master anyway. 

So this post will list out some important points that I think I need to remember about C++. I took all these notes from the book "**A Tour of C++**" by Bjarne Stroustrup (father of the C++ programming language). This post will be updated as I read through this book. 

### General

- C++ is a compiled language
- Before a program can be run, the following process happens:

    **Source file**  --- *compiler* ---> **Object file**  --- *linker* ---> **Executable file**
    
- If the program has multiple source files, each object file produced by the compiler must be combined by the linker to create the final executable file.
- An executable program is not portable, but the source file is
- C++ is a statically typed language, this means the type of any entity (variable, function, object, ...) must be known to the compiler at its point of use
